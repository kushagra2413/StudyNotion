## WebSocket Warnings

The WebSocket connection warnings (`ws://localhost:3000/ws failed`) are normal development server behavior for React's hot reload feature and do not affect application functionality.

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Environment Variables**: Set up production environment variables
2. **Database**: Configure production MongoDB connection
3. **Security**: Implement rate limiting and additional security measures
4. **Monitoring**: Add application monitoring and logging
5. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive test suite

## Usage

To start the development environment:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start both the client and server concurrently.

To test lecture completion:
1. Navigate to a course
2. Watch a video lecture
3. Click the "Mark as Completed" button
4. Check browser console and server logs for confirmation
